# Eco-Ride: Urban Mobility & Fleet Management System

## Project Overview

Eco-Ride is a Python-based Urban Mobility & Fleet Management System designed to simulate the management of electric vehicles like cars and scooters across multiple city hubs. The project focuses on applying Object-Oriented Programming  principles, data handling, and file persistence while maintaining clean, modular, and scalable code.

## Features

- Real-world simulation of urban fleet systems
- Branch-wise development for each usecase
- Modular and scalable design
- Tested using pytest

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:

- Object-Oriented Programming (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Abstraction, Polymorphism)
- Python Collections (Lists, Dictionaries)
- File Handling using CSV and JSON
- Data integrity and duplicate prevention
- Exception handling for robust user interaction
- Sorting, searching, and analytics on real-world data

## Technologies Used

- Language: Python 
- IDE: VS Code
- Libraries: 
  - abc
  - json
  - CSV
  - pytest
